## Problem

Given an array arr[] of n integers, construct a Product Array prod[] (of same size) such that prod[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of arr[] except arr[i]. Solve it without division operator in O(n) time.

## Complexity Analysis
#### Time Complexity: O(n).
- The array needs to be traversed three times, so the time complexity is O(n).
#### Space Complexity: O(n).
- Two extra arrays and one array to store the output is needed so the space complexity is O(n)
