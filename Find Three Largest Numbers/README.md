## Problem

The task is to first find the largest element, followed by the second-largest element and then excluding them both find the third-largest element. The basic idea is to iterate the array twice and mark the maximum and second maximum element and then excluding them both find the third maximum element, i.e the maximum element excluding the maximum and second maximum.

## Complexity Analysis
- O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
