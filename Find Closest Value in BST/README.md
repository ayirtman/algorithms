## Problem

Given a binary search tree and a target value, return the value in the tree closest to the target.


## Complexity Analysis
#### Average: 
- O(log(n)) time | O(1) space where n is the number of nodes in the BST
#### Worst:
- O(n) time | O(1) space where n is the umber of nodes in the BST
