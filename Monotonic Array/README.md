## Problem

In calculus, a function _f_ defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely non-increasing, or entirely non-decreasing. That is, as per Fig. 1, a function that increases monotonically does not exclusively have to increase, it simply must not decrease.


## Complexity Analysis
- O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the array
