## Problem

The two sum problem is a common interview question, and it is a variation of the subset sum problem. A naive approach to this problem would be to loop through each number and then loop again through the array looking for a pair that sums to S. The running time for the below solution would be O(n^2) because in the worst case we are looping through the array twice to find a pair. 

## Complexity Analysis
- O(n) time | O(n) space where n is the length of the input array
